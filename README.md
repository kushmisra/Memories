## Memories

## Inspiration
I have seen people wanting to save their name on places they visit but indeed indulging in harming places like monuments by inscribing their names on them.

I am a wanderer, I like to travel explore and create memories. I wanted to share this experience and leave a mark of my existence at a place and what is better than a digital copy of the same. 

But keeping a distance from mass consumerism of modern social media, this idea was kept as simple as possible.

This app was a previous idea of mine, but during Mhacks nano we were able to add few features like chat, private mode and timeline.

## What it does
Single window Signup/Login.
It lets you share and save private memories at geolocation within 5km of your current location. 
You can see other people's memories at that location and also like them.
To put a cap on a number of memories you see a timeline is added. 
Group chat to get like a chatroom to get help about the current location.

## How we built it
The basic setup like backend server, structure to share and UI components were made before adding other features like timeline, private mode and chat.


## Challenges we ran into
Setting up chat component and debugging the sharing of posts between users.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Getting the opportunity to extend the idea during Mhacks Nano.

## What's next for Memories
There us a need for Social Network integration like facebook and twitter to leverage upon the basic idea without disturbing the basic sanctity of our app.
